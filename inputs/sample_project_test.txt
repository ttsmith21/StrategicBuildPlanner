PROCUREMENT NOTES
----------------
Raw Material: 304 SS sheet, 48" x 120" x 0.125"
Supplier: Steel Supply Co. (approved vendor)
Lead Time: 3-4 weeks
Estimated cost: $850 per sheet

TOOLING REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Press brake tooling (existing)
- TIG welding fixtures (new - to be designed)
- Inspection fixtures (existing, may need modification)

TIMELINE
--------
Quote Due: October 15, 2025
PPAP Due: December 1, 2025
Production Start: January 2, 2026

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------
1. Customer to confirm packaging requirements
2. Need final confirmation on delivery frequency
3. Waiting for customer-supplied welding procedure

RISK FACTORS
-----------
- Steel prices volatile - may impact pricing
- New welding fixture design untested
- Tight delivery schedule with holiday shutdown

PREVIOUS HISTORY
---------------
Similar project completed in 2023 for ACME Corp (Part# ACME-BKT-XYZ)
Lessons learned:
- Watch weld distortion on thin material
- Customer very particular about finish quality
- Weekly shipments require robust packaging
